Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `deep_translator` for local development.

1. Fork the `deep_translator` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/deep_translator.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd path/to/project
    $ poetry shell
    $ poetry install

 .. note::

    ``poetry install`` will automatically install all package dependencies AND development dependencies. If you only want to run the package, append --no-dev to the command.

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Ensure your changes are covered by test modules and that the tests pass with pytest before committing.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include any relevant tests (located under :file:`.deep_translator/tests`)
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.rst.
3. Pull requests are automatically tested on GitHub for compatibility with Python version 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Please review your test results and ensure your request passes all tests.

Tips
----

To run only certain tests::

   $ pytest -ra

.. note::

   will run all tests, excluding any that previously passed, and provides a simple test report.

    $ pytest test_mod.py

.. note::

   Runs only the tests in the named testing module. Useful for only testing a subset of functionality.

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

   $ poetry version major|minor|patch
   $ git push
   $ git push --tags

After pushing a new version to the master branch, github will build a package and upload it to PyPI.
